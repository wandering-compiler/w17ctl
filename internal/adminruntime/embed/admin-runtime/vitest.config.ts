// Test config for the hand-written admin-runtime logic tier.
//
// `jsdom` gives auth.ts a real `window.localStorage`. Coverage is the
// JS mirror of srcgo/coverage-gate.sh: v8 provider, thresholds gate the
// suite (per docs/test-coverage.md — FLOOR 70 / TARGET 90).
//
// SCOPE: coverage.include is the pure-logic surface plus the components
// that now HAVE render tests (@testing-library/react, `.test.tsx`).
// Components are a render seam, not a unit-depth target — the tests
// assert the decisions the component makes (does the Add button appear?
// does the create form POST the declared fields?), not its markup. Add
// a component's path here once its BEHAVIOUR is covered — not merely
// once it has a render test. ListPage/App have targeted tests (the Add
// button gate, the create route guard) but are not covered end to end,
// so gating them at the threshold would be a false signal.
//
// WHERE EACH COMPONENT ACTUALLY STANDS, re-measured 2026-09-29. The 2026-09-28
// figures this block used to carry were wrong in four rows, and the cause was the
// instrument: `src/vocab.test.ts` read the sources as `?raw`, which is a MODULE whose
// coverage entry collides with the real one on the same path. See that file's comment
// and docs/decisions/which-components-belong-in-the-gate.md.

//   InlineSection.tsx    NOT in the gate, but its twin of ActionModal's crash is fixed
//                        and covered — see eventhandlers.test.ts
//   InlineSection.tsx    143/309       40/59         6/13    <- was recorded 2/100/0
//
// Counts, not percentages, because the arithmetic below has to be re-derivable: the
// gate's own base is 807/827 statements, 445/481 branch arms, 85/85 functions.
//
// ⚠️ `bootstrap.tsx` was quoted here as the one component meeting the rule, at
// 100/100/100, and it was 0 of 32 statements — nothing executed the SPA entry point at
// all, only the things it mounts. Twice now, from two unrelated causes, a component
// "reporting 100%" in this suite has meant the instrument was not reading it. That is
// why the counts are here and the percentages are derived from them.
//
// ✅ Three meet the rule for real now and are IN `coverage.include`:
//   bootstrap.tsx   — nothing had executed the SPA entry point (bootstrap.test.tsx)
//   Login.tsx       — the entire sign-in FAILURE path was untested (loginfailure.test.tsx)
//   ActionModal.tsx — nothing had ever SUBMITTED the modal; writing the first test that
//                     typed into an extra field found a live crash (actionmodal.test.tsx)
// The other six still do not meet it.
//
// ⚠️ The arithmetic below is HISTORICAL as of `perFile: true` — it is the route that
// used to exist, kept because it is the reason the route had to be closed. SIX could
// each be added ALONE without breaching the thresholds, because a 97.58% baseline
// absorbs one file's gaps: bootstrap, Login, icons, ActionModal, OverviewPage,
// DetailPage. None of that decides an admission any more: a per-file threshold asks
// only whether THAT file meets it.
//
//   bootstrap + Login + icons                        91.44 / 92.26 / 95.10   holds
//   Login + icons + OverviewPage                     91.64 / 90.41 / 93.10   holds
//   bootstrap + Login + OverviewPage + ActionModal   88.13                   breaches
//   all ten .tsx                                     76.58 / 82.60 / 72.25   breaches
//
// The largest set that holds is THREE (five such triples), not four — and the
// four-file set this block used to quote at "90.40, holds" is 88.13. A conclusion four
// tenths of a point from its threshold was reading an artefact.
//
// So nothing is added, and admitting ActionModal at 58% or OverviewPage at 80% because
// the aggregate can carry them is exactly the false signal this block warns about.
//
// ✅ The other half of that — "an AGGREGATE threshold over a dozen files does not
// protect any single file" — is FIXED rather than merely noted: `perFile: true` below.
// This block used to price it at "gating the eight components the rule says are not
// ready", and that price was imaginary: thresholds only see `coverage.include`, so the
// eight are not in the coverage map to gate. Measured — enabling it broke on one file
// and four tests closed it.
//
// The exclusion is right for the nine left out — together they carry 542 branch arms
// and 124 functions against 445/481 and 85/85 in the gate today, and admitting them
// fails all three thresholds at once (76.58 / 82.60 / 72.25).
